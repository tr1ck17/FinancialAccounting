Accrual Basis Accounting

Accrual Accounting
	Requires companies to measure and report accounting transactions regardless of whether cash has been received or paid
		Required by GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles)
	Based on two primary principles:
		Revenue Recognition
		Expense Recognition (matching)

Revenue Recognition Principle
	Revenue is recognized as the amount the seller expects to be paid for the transfer off goods or services
	Revenue may be recognized before, after or at the same time that cash is received
	
	Revenue recognized when cash is received

	April 30 | Cash (+A)		|	100|		A = L + SE
		 |	Sales Revenue(+R, +SE)     |	100	+100   +100 Rev
		     to record revenue at time of cash receipt
	
	Revenue recognized before cash is received

	April 30| Accounts receivable (+A)		| 100 | 	A = L + SE
		| 	Sales revenue (+R, +SE)		      | 100	+100	+100 Rev
		    to recognize revenue earned
	May 30	| Cash(+A)				| 100 |		A = L + SE
			Accounts Receivable (-A)	|     | 100	+100
		    to recognize cash received				-100
	
	Revenue recognized after cash is received
	
	April 30| Cash (+A)				| 100 |		A = L + SE
			Unearned revenue (+L)		|     | 100	+100 +100
		    to recognize the receipt of cash prior to revenue being earned
	May 30  | Unearned Revenue (-L)			| 100 |		A = L + SE
			Sales Revenue (+R, +SE)		|     | 100	   -100 +100 rev
		    to recognize earned revenue	

Expense Recognition (Matching) Principle
	Accounting requires that the expenses incurred to generate revenues be recognized in the same period
	Business expenses are recognized (matched) with sales revenue
	Like recognition of revenue, the recognition of expenses can occur prior to, simultaneously with, or subsequent to the payment of cash

	May 15| Baking Supplies (+A)			| 50| 		A = L + SE
			Cash (-A)			|   | 50	+50
		  to record cash payment for supplies			-50
	May 15| Baking supplies (+A)			| 50|		A = L + SE
			Accounts Payable (+L)		|   | 50	+50 +50
		 to record purchase of supplies on account

	In both above cases, the expense for the cost of goods sold is

	May 15| Cost of goods sold (+E, -SE)		| 50|		A = L + SE
			Baking Supplies (-A)		|   | 50	-50     -50
		  to record cost of product sold				Exp

Types of Adjustments
	There are four types of accounting adjustments made at the end of an accounting period:

	Deferrals:
		Prepaid Expenses
			Allocating previously recorded assets to expenses
			Assets go Down
			Expenses go Up
		Unearned Revenues
			Allocating previously recorded unearned revenue to revenue
			Liabilities go Down
			Revenue go Up
	Accruals:
		Accrued Expenses
			Recording expense that have not yet been paid
			Liabilities go Up
			Expense go Up
		Accrued Revenues
			Recording revenues that have not yet been received
			Assets go Up
			Revenue go Up

Allocating Previously Recorded Assets to Expenses
	Many expenditures benefit multiple accounting period
	These expenditures must be allocated over the period benefited
	
	Examples include purchases of buildings, equipment, and supplies:
		prepayments of rent and advertising; and prepayments of insurance premiums

	At the end of each accounting period, the estimated portion of the expenditure that has expired, or that has been used, during the period is transferred from the asset account to an expense account to acieve a proper recognition of revenue and expenses

	These adjustments are identified by inspecting the unadjusted trial balance for costs that benefit multiple accounting period

Depreciation
	Depreciation is a process of allocating the cost of long-term tangible assets to the periods benefiting from their use
	Depreciation expense is a periodic expense and is the allocation of the cost of revenue-generating assets over the many periods
	When recording depreciation expense, the asset's reduction is recorded in a contra account call Accumulated Depreciation, which has a normal credit balance

	Ex: This affects the office equipment, and is exclusive to the process of the buying of office equipment. Depreciation expense can be calculated via the price of getting the equipment and dividing it among the number of months that are equivalent to the expected useful life of the equipment. This will be the monthly linear-depreciation of the office equipment

Allocating Previously Recorded Unearned Revenue to Revenue
	Unearned revenue is recognized when a business receives fees for services or products before the services or products are rendered
	The unearned revenue account is also called deferred revenue and represents an obligation to perform a service or provide a product in the future
	Once the service or product is provided, the revenue is recognized. The required adjusting entry is debit to the unearned revenue account, which reduces the liability account, and a credit to the revenue account for the amount of revenue earned in the current period

Deferred Service Revenue
	Ex: on Dec 4, WW receives $3,000 in advance to perform work in the following 4 months
		On Dec 31, WW would make this journal entry:

	Dec 31 | Unearned Revenue (-L)			| 	750|
			Fee Revenue(+R, +SE)		|	   | 750
		   to record portion of fee advance earned in December

Recording Previously Unrecorded Expenses
	A company often incurs expenses before paying for them
	Usually the cash payments are made at regular time intervals
	If the accounting period ends on a date that does not coincide with a scheduled cash payment date, an adjusting entry must be recorded to reflect the expense incurred during the period
	Such expenses are referred to as accrued expenses

Accrued Wages
	Ex: An employee is paid every two weeks at a rate of $810 per week. The employee has worked one week by Dec 27, and wages will not be paid until January. The adjusting entry at the end of Dec to accrue one week of wage expense follows:

Dec 31 | Wage expense (+E, -SE)		| 810|
       |	Wages payable (+L)	|    | 810
	   to record accrued wages for the final week of December

Accrued Interest
	On Dec 1, WW received $36,000 bank loan with annual interest of 10 percent. The first annual interest payment is due November 30 of next year

	Principal Amount of Note   x   Annual Interest Rate   x   Time as a Fraction of a Year   =   Interest
	$36,000 		   x	10%		      x		1/12			 =	$300

Dec 31 | Interest Expense (+E, -SE)		|  300|
       |	Interest Payable (+L)		|     | 300
	    to record accrued interest expense for December

Recording Previously Unrecorded Revenues
	Revenues from selling a product or providing a service must be recognized in the period in which the goods are sold or the services are performed
	A company may provide services during a period that are neither paid for by customers nor billed at the end of the period
	The end of period adjusting entries are made to reflect any revenues for the period that have been earned but have not yet been paid or billed. Such revenue is often called accrued revenue

Accrued Fees
	On Dec 2, WW agreed to maintain a company's website in exchange for a monthly fee of $150, payable at the end of every three months. By Dec 31, WW has earned one month of fee revenue, and the following adjusting entry is made:

Dec 31 | Accounts Receivable (+A)		| 150|
       |	Fee Revenue (+R, +SE)		|    | 150
	   to record accrued fee revenue earned in December

Prepare Financial Statements
	Prepare the statements in the following order:
		Income Statement
		Statement of Stockholders' Equity
		Balance Sheet
		Statement of Cash Flows

Permanent and Temporary Accounts
	Permanent accounts are accounts whose balances carry over from one accounting period to the next
		Assets, Liabilities, Stockholders' Equity
	Temporary accounts gather information for a particular accounting period and then reset to zero by transferring the balance to Retained Earnings - a permanent account
		Revenues, Expenses, Dividends

Post-Closing Trial Balance
	A post-closing trial balance is prepared after the temporary accounts have been closed to Retained Earnings
