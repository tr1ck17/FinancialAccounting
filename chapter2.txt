Five Major steps in the accounting cycle:
	Analyze
		analyze transactions from source documents
	Record
		journalize transactions
		prepare unadjusted trial balance
	Adjust
		journalize adjusting entries
		prepare adjusted trial balance
	Report
		Prepare financial statements
	Close
		Journalize closing entries
		prepare post-closing trial balance

Analyze and record transactions using the accounting equation
	Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' Equity
	The accounting equation provides a convenient way to analyze and summarize accounting transactions
		the accounting equation must always balance so at least two elements are always affected by each recorded transaction
		double-entry accounting

Accounting Transaction
	an economic event that must be recorded in the company accounting records
	an event that affects any of the elements of the accounting equation - assets, liabilities, or stockholders equity

Expanded Accounting Equation
	Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' Equity

Using the Accounting Equation to Analyze Transactions

Transaction 1: Steve Gates invested $30,000 cash in exchange for all of the common stock of WebWork
	Assets	= Liabilities + Stockholders' Equity
	Cash	=	      + Common Stock
	+$30,000 = 	      + $30,000		Issued Stock

Transaction 2. Paid Rent in Advance, 1800 per month for 6 months, total is 10800.
	Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' Equity
     Cash + Prepaid Rent =  + Common Stock
    $30,00			$30,000
   -$10,800  + +$10,800		
   $19,200  + $10,800		$30,000
	$30,000			$30,000

Transaction 3: WW purchased $2,850 of office supplies on account
	office supplies are recorded as an asset
	on account: denotes purchase/sale of product or services on credit not for cash
	Accounts payable is the amount of cash a business needs to pay for its "on account" purchase or some incurred expenses

Transaction 4: Signed Bank Note for Cash
	Cash increases, so assets go up
	Notes Payable amount goes up, so Liabilities increase
	Interest typically comes with the bank loan

Transaction 5: Purchased Equipment with Cash
	Cash decrease, so assets go down
	Equipment increases, so assets go up
	
Transaction 6: WW received prepayment of $3,000 for services to be performed over the next few months
	Unearned Revenue: liability because the company accepted payment for goods or services that haven't been recognized
	Cash does go up, Assets increase
	Unearned Revenue goes up, Liabilities increase

Hiring an Employee that doesn't start for another few days and will be paid biweekly:
	No changes to accounting equation until money actually moves

Transaction 7: Provided Services to Customers for Cash
	Revenue increases, increases Stockholders Equity
	Cash increases, increases Assets

Transaction 8: Provided Services for Cash and On Account ($1,000 cash, $3,740 on account paid within 90 days)
	Cash goes up $1,000, Assets increase
	Account Receivable goes up $3,740, Assets Increase
	Revenue increased $,4740 -> Retained Earnings Increase -> Stockholders Equity increase

Transaction 9: Paid Employee Wages
	Employee was paid $1,620 after first two weeks
	Cash decreases, Assets Decrease
	Expenses increase (Wage expense) -> Retained Earnings Decrease -> Stockholder Equity Decrease

Transaction 10: Received Payment on Account from Customer
	WW received payment of $2,400 who'd previously received services performed on account
	Cash increases, receives $2,400, Assets increase
	Accounts Receivable decrease, lose $2,400, Assets decrease
	Assets stay the same

Transaction 11: Paid Cash Dividend
	WW paid $500 for a cash dividend
	Dividends are increased -> Retained Earnings are decreased -> Stockholders Equity is decreased
	Cash decreases -> Assets decreases

Account:
	an individual record of the increases and decreases in a specific asset, liability, or stockholders' equity item
	an account is created for each individual asset, liability, and stockholders' equity item on a company's financial statements
	some common account titles are Cash, Account Receivable, Notes Payable, Fee Revenue, and rent expense

Chart of Accounts
	is a list of the titles of all accounts in  business's accounting system
	account titles are grouped by, and in the order of, the size major components of accounting equation:
		assets, liabilities, stockholders equity, revenues, expenses, and dividends
The T-Account
	A simplified form of an account that is used to capture the effects of transactions
	
					Account Title (e.g., Cash)
				_______________________________________
				Debit (left side) | Credit (right side)
	
	Entries on the left side of any account are debits
	Entries on the right side of any account are credits

System of Debits and Credits
	Debit always refers to the left side; credit always refers to the right side
	Assets increase with debits; decrease with credits
	Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity increase with credits; decrease with debits
	The 'normal balance' of an account is the side where increases are recorded
	Revenues increase with credits; expenses increase with debits
	Dividends increase with debits

Record a journal entry for each accounting transaction in the General Journal

Journal entries include the following information:
	Date of transaction	
	Account titles affected from the chart of accounts
	Dollar amounts
	An explanation
	
Posting Transactions
	Post journal entries to the General Ledger
	A general ledger is a listing of each account of a company and the amounts making up each account. It organizes transaction by account
	Posting is a process of transferring the debit and credit information from the general journal to the general ledger is called posting

For each transactions we
	(1) analyze the transaction using the accounting equation
	(2) journalize the transaction
	(3) post journal entries to the general ledger
	
The Trial Balance
	A listing of all accounts from the general ledger with their respective debit or credit balances prepared at the end of the accounting period
		Serves as a check that Debits = Credits
		Aids in the preparation of the financial statements (but it is not a financial statement)
	Does not guarantee that the data are error-free
			Transactions that haven't been journalized
			Journal entries that have not been posted
			Journal entries posted in the wrong amounts
			Journal entries posted to the wrong accounts

Summary:
	Accounting Cycle:
		Analyze:
			analyze transactions from source documents
		Record:
			journalize transactions
			prepare unadjusted trial balance
		Adjust:
			journalize adjusting entries
			prepare adjusted trial balance
		Report:
			prepare financial statements
		Close:
			journalize closing entries
			prepare post-closing trial balance
	Accounting Transaction:
		an event that affects any of the elements of the accounting equation - assets, liabilities, or stockholders' equity
	The Double-Entry Accounting System:
		whenever an accounting transaction is created, at least two accounts are always impacted

	Four Types of Transactions:
		asset source transactions:
			increase total assets and total claims, such as acquisition of assets by issuing common stock, acquisition of assets by assuming liabilities, and providing services or goods to customers

		asset exchange transactions:
			trade one asset for other assets, such as purchase of land, purchase of inventory, purchase of patent and so on

		asset use transactions:
			decrease total assets and total claims, such as payment of expenses, dividend distributions, and purchase back of capital stock

		claims exchange transactions: increase on claim and decrease another claim, such as accruing interest expense, earning unearned revenue

	Prepaid Items:
		future expenses that have been paid in advance. it's an asset account. as prepaid items are used, the number of prepaid items is reduced, and the amount of the reduction is reported as an expense

	Supplies:
		the cost of supplies on hand at a point in time. it's an asset account

	"On Account": an accounting term that denotes the purchase/sale of product or services on credit not for cash

	Accounts payable:
		the amount of cash that a business need pay for its "on account" purchase or some incurred expenses

	Supplies expense: the amount supplies that were used during the accounting period

	Notes payable:
		are written promises to pay cash at some future date. Notes usually require the payment of explicit interest in addition to the original obligation amount

	Unearned Revenue:
		an obligation to performance services or provide goods in the future. As the service/goods are provided, the amount of unearned revenue is reduced, and the amount of the reduction is reported as revenues. Unearned Revenue is a liabilities account

	Accounts Receivable:
		the amount of cash the company expects to collect in the future. It's an asset account
