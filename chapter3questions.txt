The Arizona Saguaros Soccer Team sells season tickets and collects the cash in January at the beginning of the season. They collected $24,000 for season tickets. The soccer season starts in February and the season tickets are for 10 games. In February, the team played 2 games. What adjusting journal entry would the Arizona Saguaros record at the end of February?
	$24,000 / 10 = $2,400 per game, 2 games = $4,800. The Revenue was Unearned at the point of the sales of season passes, but they did have revenue. So money should move from Liabilities to Stockholders' Equity, where Unearned Revenue decreases at the end of Feb, and Revenue increase at the end of Feb, meaning Unearned Revenue under liabilities gets debited and Revenue under Equity gets credited. So, 
	Account Name			Debit			Credit
	Unearned Revenue		4,800
	Revenue							4,800
